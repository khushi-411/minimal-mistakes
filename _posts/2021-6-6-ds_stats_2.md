## **Exploratory Statistical Analysis**

The process of analysing data so as to take out some important characteristics from it, is known as **exploratory data analysis**. Performing data analysis through statistical methods like `mode`, `probability`, `expected value`, `correlation` etc is known as **exploratory statistical analysis.**

### **Exploring Binary and Categorical Data**

**Binary Data:** Data which can take only two possible values, 0 or 1.

**Categorical Data:** Data which has been divided into categories or groups according to their features.

#### **Mode**

* `Mode` is the value that appear most offten in dataset.
* It is a summay statistic for **categorical data** i.e. grouped data or set of values representing a possible categories.
* It is not used for **numeric data** i.e. data expressed in number scale.
