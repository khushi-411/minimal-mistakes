**Data Science** is basically a data driven approach which helps us to analyse data and make decisions accordingly so as to predict results with better accuracy. It involves the following procedure:

* Data Analysis (or Business Understanding)
* Data Pre-Processing (Data Mining, Data Cleaning, Data Exploration, Feature Engineering)
* Data Visualization
* Model Building & Evaluation (Predictive Modeling)

This part of my blog will consists of `Data Analysis`, `Data Pre-Processing` and `Data Visualization`:

# **Data Analysis** 

**Data Analysis** refers to the process of collecting and defining the data according to our need, cleaning unnessary stuffs and then finally analyzing those data so as to apply them in the predictive model. 

There are mainly four types of `Data Analysis` methods:

* Descriptive Analysis --- What happened?
* Exploratory Analysis --- How 
* Predictive Analysis --- What is likely to happen i future?
* Inferential Analysis
