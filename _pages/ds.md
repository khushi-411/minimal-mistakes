**Data Science** is basically a data driven approach which helps us to analyse data and make decisions accordingly so as to predict results with better accuracy. It involves the following procedure:

* Data Pre-Processing (Data Mining, Data Cleaning, Data Exploration, Feature Engineering)
* Data Visualization
* Model Building & Evaluation (Predictive Modeling)
