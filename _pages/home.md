Myself **Khushi Agrawal** presently a pre-final year student doing my graduation from International Institute of Information Technology, Naya Raipur. It's really been a great journey throughout these years. I kept stumbling over the internet to gain knowledge. Some of the times I wasted my time while searching about things which were not useful, these blogs will help you out to gain knowledge in minimal time.

I'm having keen interest about *Computer Vision*. I love to process images. I also have some basic grip about *Machine Learning*, *Deep Learning* and *Data Science*. 

Apart from these, I love to *Draw sketches* and make *Crafts* in my part timr
