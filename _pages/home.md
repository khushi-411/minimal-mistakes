Hey Everyone! This is Khushi Agrawal, I'm a pre-final year student pursuing my graduation from IIIT-NR in Data Science & Artificial Intelligence. Currently, I'm doing internship at The Quansight Labs! I'm working on adding Benchmarks to NumPy Library. 

Apart from technical stuffs, I love to draw different types of arts (majorly landscape & zentangle). I also love traveling and reading books. I love to learn different things from different people and that's the reason why I love working in a team which lead me diving into The Open Source World<3!

Any kind of discussions related to the above topics are most welcome in my [Mail box](https://khushiagrawal411@gmail.com) or [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/khushi-agrawal-413511194)!
