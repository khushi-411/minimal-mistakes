# Greetings To You!

Hey Everyone! This is Khushi Agrawal, I’m a pre-final year student pursuing my graduation from IIIT-NR in Data Science & Artificial Intelligence. Currently, I’m doing an internship at The Quansight Labs! I’m working on adding Benchmarks to NumPy Library. I love to learn new things. 

### Technical Skills

* **Programming Language:** C++, Python, C
* **Libraries & Frameworks:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Bokeh, OpenCV, PyTorch, Scikit-Learn
* **Platform:** Linux, Windows

### Extra-Curricular Interests

Apart from technical stuff, I love to draw different types of arts (majorly landscape & zentangle). I also love traveling and reading books. I love to learn different things from different people and that’s the reason why I love working in a team which leads me diving into The Open Source World<3!
